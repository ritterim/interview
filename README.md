# RIMdev Technical Interview

The purpose of this exercise is to understand an applicants ability to *problem solve*, *think critically*, and *write software* with existing RIMdev team members. While there is no expected answer, we do expect the production of a working sample. That means the work must compile, transpile, or interpert and above all else run with no immediate exceptions.

While accomplishing this exercise is permitted before interviewing at Ritter Insurance Marketing, it may also be completed in collaboration with the interviewers.

You, as the interviewee, are encouraged to:

1. Ask Questions
1. Search the internet
